= Writing your lab

== Variables

The `lab_name` var, known as an asciidoc attribute, is set in `site.yml` and can be used to set the lab_name (Example: {lab_name}) or title of your content.
They are both free to change its value and if you prefer to use a different var name, you can change the value of `lab_name`, for example to `title` in `site.yml` and then reference it in your content as `\{site-title}` (Ex: {site-title}).

Example:
[source,bash,run]
----
podman run -u : --rm -v $HOME/.config:/config:Z \
-v $HOME/.local/bin:/config/.local/bin:Z \
registry.redhat.io/rhel-cla/installer-rhel10:latest
